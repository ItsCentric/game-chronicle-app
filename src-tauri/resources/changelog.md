Some minor stuff this time around, but I promise I'm _still_ cooking.

### Popular Games

The random games displayed on the game search page will now show popular games instead of random games.

### Multi-Day Sessions

Started playing a game just before midnight? Had too many "just one more game"s? You can now specify the day you started your session and the day you ended.

### Similar Games Page

I honestly don't understand how it took me so long to realize but... I never actually implemented this even though it's on the dashboard... embarassing...

### Smoke and Mirrors

You can no longer access the browser context menu (the thing that appears when you right click) to keep the illusion.

### Bug Fixes

- You can now search for games again, sorry.
- The application no longer sometimes breaks after an update
