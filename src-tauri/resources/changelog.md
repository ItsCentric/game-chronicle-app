Hey me! Need a reminder of what's new in the latest version of Game Chronicle? Look no further!

### Beta Channel

That's how you're seeing this right now! Beta channels are for testing new features and updates before they're released to the public. If you're seeing this, you're a beta tester! Thanks for helping me test new features and updates!

### Bug fixes

- Game playtime now correctly auto fills again after closing a game
- Logs page now correctly displays 12 logs per page instead of 16
- Similar games page is now fixed... overlooked that page during the redesign
