Hey! It's been a few weeks since the last update, and no time has gone to waste since then! Game Chronicle is now (insert unrealistic percentage here) faster! Seriously though, it is way faster to get to the pages you want. Let's take a look, shall we?

### Twitch Credentials No More!

The need to provide your own Twitch credentials has been removed! No more figuring that tedious process anymore. Same is soon to come for Steam as well.

### Changelog, duh!

As you've probably already noticed since you're reading this, a changelog will now let you know what's new with every update!

### Gotta go fast

As mentioned before, the application should now load pages significantly faster than before.

### Window, window, go away

The application will now start in the system tray when you start up your computer if you have autostart enabled instead of popping up every time.

### Bug fixes

Ugh, I know... so boring... let's get them out of the way...

- Log filters on the "My Logs" page are properly capitalized
- Multiple logs for the same game no longer count as a new game in the "Games played" statistic
- Stuff like anti-cheat will no longer be detected by game detection
- Updater is no longer broken (hopefully), woohoo!
- Settings now persist between updates
